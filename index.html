	<h2>Project abstract</h2>
	<p>
	  The goal of this project is performing shadow removal from
	  images of faces. Faces are often a key feature in pictures, but
	  sometimes, bad lighting in the scene with possible combination
	  of non-optimal camera settings, can cause faces to look too
	  dark and covered with shadows.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To achive our goal of removing shadow, Our method uses multiple
	  images of the person in good lighting conditions to fix an image
	  with shadows. The following describes the ideas and methods
	  implemented.
	</p>

	<h2>Introduction: intrinsic images</h2>
	<p>
	  Intrinsic images are a useful midlevel description of scenes
	  proposed by Barrow and Tenenbaum.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The intrinsics of an image are composed of two parts:
	  reflectance, and illumination. These are defined such that
	  multiplying the reflectance with the illumination, we get the
	  original image, as illustrated here:
	</p>
	<img src="images/intrinsic.gif" border="1" width="600px">
	<p>
	  To remove the multiplication, we work with the log domain.
	</p>

	<h2>Finding the intrinsics of an image</h2>
	<p>
	  Deriving intrinsic images from image sequences (<i>Yair Wiess</i>):

	  given a sequence of images as input, we solve this equation:
	  $I(x,y,t)=R(x,y)L(x,y,t)$ and find $R(x,y)$, where $R(x,y)$ is
	  constant in all images.
	</p>
	
	<p>How does it work?</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>We take 2 derivative filters, horizental and vertical.</li>
	  <li>Convolve every derivative filter with every image in the sequence.</li>
	  <li>Now we take all horizental derivative images and implement an image by median of all of them.</li>
	  <li>We do the same for the vertical derivative images.</li>
	  <li>Now we have 2 images.</li>
	</ul>

	<img src="images/median.gif">

	<p>Illustration As shown in Yair's article:</p>

	<p>Note that all images must be aligned.</p>

	<p>
	  Now we need to transform back to the original image and find 'r'.
	  To do so we solve the linear equations:
	</p>
	<img src="images/solveequation.gif">.

	<p>
	  Solution is given by these equations:

	<h2>Warping faces</h2>
	<p>
	  The above algorithm assumes that the images are aligned. To use
	  it we need to first warp the faces to be aligned as closly as
	  possible to the face which we want to fix.
	</p>
